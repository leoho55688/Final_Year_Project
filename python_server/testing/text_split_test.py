Capital Structure and Valuation
(Part 1)

Figure 13.2: USA Debt Ratios
Long-term Debt to (Long-term Debt + Equity) Ratio for Non-Financial Firms

Capital Structure: Schools of Thought
• Trade-off Theory: assumes strong-form EM
o Find the borrowing ratio that will max the market value of the company
(will also max shareholders’ wealth)
• Company value is affected by market imperfection: tax shield from
interest expenses versus financial distress costs
o WACC and valuation formulae
• Other schools of thought …
3
Trade-off Theory: Modigliani and Miller
Assuming a perfect market first (no taxes, no transaction
costs such as bankruptcy costs, strong-form EM); later
only assuming strong-form EM
The value of a firm : described by Balance Sheet (in
market value)
• Given the assets, will a change in the borrowing ratio affect the
total value of assets (= PV of all the future cash flows)?
4
Perfect market: capital structure doesn’t matter
Example - You own all the equity of a company. The company
has no debt. Its annual expected EBIT is $1,000. The
corporate tax rate is 0%. You may exchange some of your
equity position for bonds (so, neither conflict between
bondholder and stockholder nor bankruptcy costs).
 All Equity Some Debt
EBIT 1,000 1,000
Interest 0 100
Pretax Income 1,000 900
Taxes @ 0% 0 0
Dividend $1000 $900
Your Cash Flow
“All Equity” =
1000
“Some Debt” =
900 + 100 = 1000

MM Proposition 1
Expected EBIT from assets and the business risk (riskiness
of EBIT) are not affected by how assets are financed
•EBIT is only split into interests (risk-free) and dividends
(risky).
MM Proposition 1: The value of a firm
•= PV (future cash flows)
•is determined by the assets, not by D/E
❑ Thus, only capital budgeting policy matters, borrowing
policy and payout policy don’t matter

Value of a Firm: MM Proposition 1
For brevity, E(r) is written as r (E.g., E(rE
) is written as rE
)
•Assume a zero-growth firm (dividend = net income, net capital spending
= depreciation; see the next slide)
•rA is the same for firm Unleveraged or firm Leveraged
▪rf + βA
(rM – rf
)
▪βA
: risk of EBIT (business risk, affected by βrev and operating leverage)
▪can be estimated using βE and financial leverage (see Notes3 and later notes)
•E is PV of expected dividend discounted by rE
, which is equal to (higher
than) rA for an unleveraged (leveraged) firm (see Notes 3 and later notes)
•D is PV of interest discounted by rD, almost risk-free
7
Net Cash Flow (NCF): Chapter 6
(in Chapter 18, NCF is renamed as Free Cash Flow)
• The value of a project = PV of expected NCF
▪ NCF = Operating Cash Flow (OCF) – net capital
spending (NCS) – changes in Net Working Capital
(NWC)
▪ OCF = EBIT + depreciation – taxes (calculated as if no
interest expenses)
▪ NPV of a new project = the value of the project – initial
cash outflows for the project
• MM assume a zero-growth firm (perpetual
expected cash flows)
▪ depreciation = NCS, trivial annual changes in NWC
▪ Thus, NCF = EBIT - taxes (calculated as if no interest
expenses) = EBIT(1-TC
)
• For a company, NCF is usually renamed as FCF 8

Corporate Taxes
Example - You own all the equity of a company. The
company has no debt. Its annual expected EBIT is
$1,000. The corporate tax rate is 40%. You may
exchange some of your equity position for bonds (so,
neither conflict between bondholder and stockholder nor
bankruptcy costs).
 All Equity Some Debt
EBIT 1,000 1,000
Interest 0 100
Pretax Income 1,000 900

“All Equity” = 600
“Some Debt” = 540 + 100

Interest Tax Shield
• Tax shield = 40 = 540 – 500 (= the dividend if
interest weren’t regarded as expenses for tax calculation)
▪ = TC

E decreases < D increases
• E’s decrease = D’s increase if Tc = 0
– the number of shares outstanding decreases
– no change in share price
• there is no advantage or disadvantage from borrowing
• In the previous slide, E’s decrease < D’s increase if
Tc > 0
– the number of shares outstanding decreases when D
increases
– share price will increase due to PV(tax shield)
• In the next slide, E’s decrease = D’s increase and share
price will not increase if interest were not regarded as
expenses for tax calculation, i.e., PV(tax shield) = 0

Consequences
• A special case
– The same personal tax rates for the incomes from debt
and equity
– Then, VL
- VU = financial leverage gain = TC D
– E.g., both TPE and TPD = 0 in HK
23
❖In general: two opposing forces
(1) corporate taxes encourage debt financing
(2) the difference between TPD (higher) and TPE
(lower) discourages debt financing
❖(1) > (2), so 0 < financial leverage gain < TC D
▪ USA 2013-2017:
• TC = 40%
• max tax rates for dividend income and capital gains
= 23.8%, max tax rate for interest income = 43.4%

Trump’s tax changes, Jan 2018
• Federal TC was reduced from 35% to 21%, while overall
TC was reduced from 40% to 25%−27%
• Interest leading to interest tax shield is limited to 30% of
EBITDA (note that most large US corporations’ interest payments are
not hitting this limit, since their debt ratios are not very high)
• Roughly speaking, max TPE stays at 23.8%, while max
TPD was reduced to 40.8%
• Assuming overall TC
is 26%, average TPE is now 12%,
average TPD is now 20%, then
▪ VU increases from 0.528VU,no tax to 0.651VU,no tax because of a
smaller TC
▪ VL = VU + 0.186D
• Biden said he will make changes
• If VL
is increasing with D, why we do not observe very
high debt ratios for US firms or HK firms?
27
Tax shield versus financial distress
• The VL formula has exaggerated the tax
shield when D is large (see the next slide)
–The formula assumes that all the interest
expenses will lead to tax savings
–Interest leading to interest tax shield is limited to
30% of EBITDA for a US firm (limited to EBIT for a
HK firm), so when D is large, not all of interest
expenses will lead to tax savings
• This leads to a diminishing marginal increase in tax
shield when D increases
• Max PV (tax shield) is affected by annual E(EBITDA)
for a US firm (annual E(EBIT) for a HK firm)

Tax shield versus financial distress
• The VL formula has exaggerated the tax

– This leads to a diminishing marginal increase in
tax shield when D increases
• Bondholders and stockholders are different
people
–PV(costs of financial distress) increases with the
debt ratio
• PV(“probability1 x cost of problem1 + probability2 x
cost of problem2 + …” in future years)

Part of financial distress costs:
bankruptcy costs
• Loss in the value of a leveraged firm:
–direct bankruptcy costs : legal and
administrative costs of liquidation
–indirect bankruptcy costs :
• difficulties of running the company while it is
going through bankruptcy (since liquidation can
take long time): leading to decrease in EBIT
• see the textbook for some other examples
32
Costs of financial distress
before actual bankruptcy
• Financial distress means significant
probability of bankruptcy, or the state when
promises to creditors are broken or honored
with difficulty
• Difficulties of running a financially distressed
company
1. Financing: needs to raise new debt on the
maturity date of an existing debt
• In usual days: quite easy to raise new debt
• In credit crunch during crises: need to cut regular
dividend and new projects, sell assets, or issue new
shares

Costs of financial distress
before actual bankruptcy
• Difficulties of running a financially distressed
company (continued)
2. Operations: relations with customers, suppliers, and
employees?
• Bad, of course
• Leading to decrease in EBIT (hence, leveraged firm’s value)
3. Conflicts of interests between creditors and
stockholders becoming more severe: “agency
problem of debt”
• Equity can then be regarded as a call option (see later notes),
rather than a usual common stock, and the call option’s
underlying asset is the firm.
• Stockholders may then exploit creditors
– An e.g.: invest in risky projects rather than +NPV projects

Invest in risky projects or good projects?
• the distressed firm accepts Y, even if NPV of
Y is negative, e.g., prob(-$15) > prob(+$15)
• the healthy firm accepts Z, which has +NPV
• What is the reason for the difference?
– The distressed firm shareholders play gambles
using lenders’ money
– The principal of lenders’ money is the debtholders,
but the CEO, acting as the agent, serves the
stockholders
– “agency problem of debt”
45
• Lenders protect themselves against gambles or
games played at their expense by imposing more
and more protective covenants when debt ratios
become higher and higher
– bond rating agencies also warn bond investors by
downgrading the bonds
• Direct costs of monitoring: a new batch of bonds
will have higher YTM required
Agency problem of debt
46
• Indirect costs of monitoring
– protective covenants will impose constraints
and inefficiency to the firm
• operating and investment decisions of the firm
affected (e.g., creditors may veto quite risky
projects even if +NPV)
• Obviously, agency costs of debt is
increasing with debt ratio, pulling
down VL
