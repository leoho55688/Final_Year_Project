Figure 13.2: USA Debt Ratios
Long-term Debt to (Long-term Debt + Equity) Ratio for Non-Financial Firms

**Meaning:**

This chunk presents a figure showing the long-term debt ratios of non-financial firms in the USA.

**Chunk 3:**

**Text:**

Capital Structure: Schools of Thought
• Trade-off Theory: assumes strong-form EM
o Find the borrowing ratio that will max the market value of the company
(will also max shareholders’ wealth)
• Company value is affected by market imperfection: tax shield from
interest expenses versus financial distress costs
o WACC and valuation formulae
• Other schools of thought …

**Meaning:**

This chunk introduces different schools of thought on capital structure, including the trade-off theory, which considers the balance between tax benefits and financial distress costs.

**Chunk 4:**

**Text:**

Trade-off Theory: Modigliani and Miller
Assuming a perfect market first (no taxes, no transaction
costs such as bankruptcy costs, strong-form EM); later
only assuming strong-form EM
The value of a firm : described by Balance Sheet (in
market value)
• Given the assets, will a change in the borrowing ratio affect the
total value of assets (= PV of all the future cash flows)?

**Meaning:**

This chunk discusses the trade-off theory proposed by Modigliani and Miller, which assumes a perfect market and strong-form efficient markets.

**Chunk 5:**

**Text:**

Perfect market: capital structure doesn’t matter
Example - You own all the equity of a company. The company
has no debt. Its annual expected EBIT is $1,000. The
corporate tax rate is 0%. You may exchange some of your
equity position for bonds (so, neither conflict between
bondholder and stockholder nor bankruptcy costs).
 All Equity Some Debt
EBIT 1,000 1,000
Interest 0 100
Pretax Income 1,000 900
Taxes @ 0% 0 0
Dividend $1000 $900
Your Cash Flow
“All Equity” =
1000
“Some Debt” =
900 + 100 = 1000

**Meaning:**

This chunk provides an example to illustrate that in a perfect market, capital structure does not affect the value of a firm.

**Chunk 6:**

**Text:**

MM Proposition 1
Expected EBIT from assets and the business risk (riskiness
of EBIT) are not affected by how assets are financed
•EBIT is only split into interests (risk-free) and dividends
(risky).
MM Proposition 1: The value of a firm
•= PV (future cash flows)
•is determined by the assets, not by D/E
❑ Thus, only capital budgeting policy matters, borrowing
policy and payout policy don’t matter

**Meaning:**

This chunk presents Modigliani and Miller's Proposition 1, which states that the value of a firm is determined by its assets and not by its capital structure.

Value of a Firm: MM Proposition 1
For brevity, E(r) is written as r (E.g., E(rE
) is written as rE
)
•Assume a zero-growth firm (dividend = net income, net capital spending
= depreciation; see the next slide)
•rA is the same for firm Unleveraged or firm Leveraged
▪rf + βA
(rM – rf
)
▪βA
: risk of EBIT (business risk, affected by βrev and operating leverage)
▪can be estimated using βE and financial leverage (see Notes3 and later notes)
•E is PV of expected dividend discounted by rE
, which is equal to (higher
than) rA for an unleveraged (leveraged) firm (see Notes 3 and later notes)
•D is PV of interest discounted by rD, almost risk-free

**Meaning:**

This chunk provides a mathematical formula for the value of a firm based on Modigliani and Miller's Proposition 1.

**Chunk 8:**

**Text:**

Net Cash Flow (NCF): Chapter 6
(in Chapter 18, NCF is renamed as Free Cash Flow)
• The value of a project = PV of expected NCF
▪ NCF = Operating Cash Flow (OCF) – net capital
spending (NCS) – changes in Net Working Capital
(NWC)
▪ OCF = EBIT + depreciation – taxes (calculated as if no
interest expenses)
▪ NPV of a new project = the value of the project – initial
cash outflows for the project
• MM assume a zero-growth firm (perpetual
expected cash flows)
▪ depreciation = NCS, trivial annual changes in NWC
▪ Thus, NCF = EBIT - taxes (calculated as if no interest
expenses) = EBIT(1-TC
)
• For a company, NCF is usually renamed as FCF

**Meaning:**

This chunk defines net cash flow (NCF) and explains how it is used to calculate the value of a project.

**Chunk 10:**

**Text:**

E decreases when D increases
• E’s decrease = D’s increase
– the number of shares outstanding decreases
– no change in share price
• there is no advantage or disadvantage from
borrowing

**Meaning:**

This chunk explains that in a perfect market with no corporate taxes, increasing debt does not affect the value of a firm.

Corporate Taxes
Example - You own all the equity of a company. The
company has no debt. Its annual expected EBIT is
$1,000. The corporate tax rate is 40%. You may
exchange some of your equity position for bonds (so,
neither conflict between bondholder and stockholder nor
bankruptcy costs).
 All Equity Some Debt
EBIT 1,000 1,000
Interest 0 100
Pretax Income 1,000 900
Taxes @ 40% 400 360
Dividend $600 $540
Your Cash Flow
“All Equity” = 600
“Some Debt” = 540 + 100
= 640

**Meaning:**

This chunk provides an example to illustrate the impact of corporate taxes on the value of a firm.

**Chunk 14:**

**Text:**

Interest Tax Shield
• Tax shield = 40 = 540 – 500 (= the dividend if
interest weren’t regarded as expenses for tax calculation)
▪ = TC
(DrD
)
• PV (future tax shields) = TCDrD
/ rD = TCD,
assuming a zero-growth firm

**Meaning:**

This chunk explains the concept of the interest tax shield and how it can be calculated.
