			"correct_answer": "(A) By increasing government spending",
			"explanation": "Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy. Increasing government spending can stimulate economic growth by increasing aggregate demand. Reducing taxes can also have a positive impact on economic growth by increasing disposable income and investment.

			"explanation": "Keynesian economics emphasizes the role of aggregate demand in determining economic output. Aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in an economy. It is the sum of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Keynesian economists argue that aggregate demand is the primary determinant of output because it determines the level of production in the economy. When aggregate demand is high, businesses will produce more goods and services, and the economy will grow. When aggregate demand is low, businesses will produce less goods and services, and the economy will contract.",

			"correct_answer": "All of the above",
			"explanation": "Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital forms of fiat currencies issued by central banks. They have the potential to offer several benefits, including:\n\n    * **Increased financial inclusion:** CBDCs can make it easier for people who do not have access to traditional banking services to participate in the financial system. This is because CBDCs can be used to make payments and store value without the need for a bank account.\n    * **Reduced transaction costs:** CBDCs can reduce transaction costs by eliminating the need for intermediaries such as banks and credit card companies. This can make it cheaper for businesses to accept payments and for consumers to make purchases.\n    * **Enhanced security:** CBDCs can be more secure than traditional fiat currencies because they are based on blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that makes it very difficult to counterfeit or hack CBDCs.",

				"All of the above"
			],
			"correct_answer": "All of the above",
			"explanation": "Central banks are responsible for managing a country's monetary policy, which includes setting interest rates, printing money, and regulating banks. \n\n* **Setting interest rates:** Central banks set interest rates to influence the cost of borrowing and lending in the economy. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow money, which can slow down economic growth. Lower interest rates make it cheaper to borrow money, which can stimulate economic growth.\n\n* **Printing money:** Central banks print money to increase the money supply in the economy. This can help to stimulate economic growth by making it easier for businesses to invest and hire workers. However, printing too much money can lead to inflation, which is a general increase in prices.\n\n* **Regulating banks:** Central banks regulate banks to ensure that they are safe and sound. This includes setting capital requirements, which are the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve. Central banks also supervise banks to make sure that they are not taking on too much risk.",

			],
			"correct_answer": "(B) A symmetric encryption algorithm",
			"explanation": "A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a cryptographic algorithm that generates a short, fixed-length code that is used to authenticate a message. The MAC is generated using a secret key that is shared between the sender and receiver of the message. When the receiver receives the message, they can use the MAC to verify that the message came from the sender and that it has not been tampered with. Symmetric encryption algorithms are used to encrypt and decrypt data using the same key. This makes them faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption algorithms, which use different keys for encryption and decryption. MACs are typically used to protect the integrity of messages, such as financial transactions or medical records.",

			"answers": [
				"Data confidentiality",
				"Key distribution",
				"Message integrity",
				"Computational complexity"
			],
			"correct_answer": "Key distribution",
			"explanation": "Symmetric encryption requires the sender and receiver to share a secret key, which can be difficult to distribute securely. \n    If the key is intercepted by an unauthorized party, they can decrypt the messages. \n    Therefore, key distribution is a major limitation of using symmetric encryption for secure communication.",

				"(D) Verifies message authenticity"
			],
			"correct_answer": "(A) Provides non-repudiation",
			"explanation": "Digital signatures provide two main benefits: authentication and non-repudiation. \n    Authentication ensures that the message came from the claimed sender, while non-repudiation ensures that the sender cannot deny having sent the message. \n    Encryption, message confidentiality, and message authenticity are all benefits of other cryptographic techniques.",
